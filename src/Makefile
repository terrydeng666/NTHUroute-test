##  Follow Peter Miller's advice in his paper "Recursive Make
##  Considered Harmful".  Load all the subdirectory dependencies and
##  build the whole package from this directory instead of cd'ing
##  to each subdirectory and running make there.
##
##  Each foo/Make-defs file defines targets foo_all and foo_clean.
